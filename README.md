## Technologies
### * React
React is a JavaScript library used to create user interfaces. It was used to create the login and CRM itself. an example of some React JavaScript code can be seen below   
```javascript
import React, { Component } from 'react';
import './App.css';
import NavBar from './components/NavBar';
import Sidebar from './components/Sidebar';
import Footer from './components/Footer';
class App extends Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <NavBar />
        <Sidebar />
        <Footer />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

export default App;
```
You will notice that there are multiple components being imported in the code displayed above. This is how React creates complex user interfaces. An example of this react code can be seen below.
```javascript
import React from 'react';
import './Footer.css';

export default function Footer() {
  return (
    <footer className='sticky-footer bg-dark'>
      <div className='text-center'>
        <span className='text-muted'>Copyright &copy; 2020 oh CRUD</span>
      </div>
    </footer>
  );
}

```

### * Sequelize
Sequelize is a Node.js ORM. In this application it is used to transfer data from a MYSQL database and display it in our React interface. Below is an example of this code.
```javascript
const db = require(`../models`);

module.exports = app => {
  app.get(`/api/sales`, (req, res) => {
    db.Shoe.findAll({
      attributes: [
        [db.sequelize.literal(`SUM(inventory_sold * retail_price)`), `result`]
      ]
    }).then(totalSold => {
      res.json(totalSold);
    });
  });

  app.get(`/api/costs`, (req, res) => {
    db.Shoe.findAll({
      attributes: [
        [db.sequelize.literal(`SUM(inventory_sold * cost)`), `result`]
      ]
    }).then(totalCost => {
      res.json(totalCost);
    });
  });

  app.get(`/api/materials`, (req, res) => {
    db.Supplier.findAll({
      attributes: [
        [db.sequelize.literal(`SUM(supplies_purchased * unit_cost)`), `result`]
      ]
    }).then(totalCost => {
      res.json(totalCost);
    });
  });
};
```

### * MySQL 
MySql is the database used for this application. Below is an example of some data the application was initially used to seed the Shoes database
```sql
INSERT INTO Shoes (sku, style, name, inventory, inventory_sold, retail_price, cost, createdAt, UpdatedAt)
VALUES ("BB0001", "basketball", "dunk force", 1263, 1454, 129.99, 47.67, "2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040","2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040"), ("BB0002", "basketball", "hyper air", 263, 4552, 169.99, 77.46, "2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040","2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040"), 
("BB0003", "basketball", "ultra max hi", 11233, 22312, 159.99, 64.68, "2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040","2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040"), ("BB0004", "basketball", "ultra max lo", 15246, 21231, 109.99, 42.41, "2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040","2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040"),

("RU0024", "running shoe", "SXX 550", 3263, 12233, 149.99, 67.99, "2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040","2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040"), ("RU0008", "running shoe", "SXX 450", 23450, 34286, 129.99, 47.89, "2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040","2020-03-07 22:01:45.8040"),

## Summary
This CRM was created using React, Sequelize, and MySQL. The interface of the application was created with React. There is a template that is created and then each React component is imported into the template. The data displayed within each component is done so with Sequelize. A few examples of the data we retrieve are total sales, total supply cost, and shoe inventory. With Sequelize the application also has the ability to add new data to a table or delete data from a table.  There Are a total of 4 tables for this application. For a more in depth overview of how this application works see the diagram below.

## Future Imporovements

- Create a beter log in system where the Admin can track User's activity. 
- Be able to give User the permissions/ rights to be an Admin.
